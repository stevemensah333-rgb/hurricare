# HurriCare - Geo-Insight Challenge

A full-stack interactive web application that visualizes mismatches between humanitarian need and pooled-fund coverage using real historical hurricanes as scenarios.

## Features

- **3D Interactive Globe**: Rotatable, zoomable globe with Three.js and react-three-fiber, space-themed with glowing components
- **Historical Hurricane Visualization**: Animated tracks for 40+ major hurricanes (Katrina, Sandy, Maria, Harvey, Haiyan, Dorian, and more)
- **Coverage Analysis**: Visualize gaps between estimated need and pooled fund coverage
- **Project Analysis**: Sortable, filterable table of humanitarian projects
- **Anomaly Detection**: IQR-based flagging of outlier projects (high/low budget per beneficiary)
- **Three-Stage Simulation Engine**:
  - **Stage 1: User Plan**: Design your own response plan with cluster-based allocation per region
  - **Stage 2: ML Ideal Plan**: AI-optimized plan based on UN humanitarian principles
  - **Stage 3: Real-World Response**: Historical actual allocations
  - **Comparison Dashboard**: Side-by-side comparison with mismatch analysis and downloadable reports

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd stormline/backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd stormline/frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Data Assumptions

### Hurricane Data
- Hurricane tracks are approximate but geographically accurate
- Based on real historical events from 2005-2019
- Includes: Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Maria (2017), Harvey (2017), Haiyan (2013), Dorian (2019)

### Project Data
- **Synthetic but realistic**: Projects are generated based on typical humanitarian response patterns
- **10-30 projects per hurricane**: Varying by hurricane severity and affected population
- **Clusters**: WASH, Shelter, Food Security, Health, Protection, Education, Livelihoods, Energy
- **Pooled Fund Coverage**: Approximately 70-75% of projects are funded through pooled funds
- **Budget Range**: $100,000 - $8,000,000 per project
- **Beneficiaries**: 2,000 - 200,000 per project

### Severity & Needs Data
- **Severity Index**: 0.0 - 1.0 scale (higher = more severe)
- **Estimated People in Need**: Based on affected population and severity
- **Unit Cost**: $500 USD per person for estimated need budget calculation
- **Coverage Ratio**: `pooled_fund_budget / estimated_need_budget`

### Flagging Logic
- Uses Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers
- Groups projects by (country, cluster) for comparison
- Flags projects where `budget_per_beneficiary` is:
  - **High Outlier**: > Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
  - **Low Outlier**: < Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
- Requires minimum 3 projects per group for statistical validity

### Simulation Model
- **Impact Score Formula**:
  ```
  impact_score = w1 × lives_covered + w2 × vulnerability_reduction × 1000 - w3 × unmet_need
  ```
  Where:
  - `w1 = 1.0` (lives covered weight)
  - `w2 = 0.5` (vulnerability reduction weight)
  - `w3 = 0.3` (unmet need penalty weight)
- **Lives Covered**: `min(allocated_budget / unit_cost, people_in_need)`
- **Vulnerability Reduction**: `coverage × severity_index`
- **Unmet Need**: `max(0, people_in_need - lives_covered) × severity_index`

## Color Coding

### Hurricane Categories
- Category 1: Light Green (#90EE90)
- Category 2: Gold (#FFD700)
- Category 3: Dark Orange (#FF8C00)
- Category 4: Red Orange (#FF4500)
- Category 5: Dark Red (#8B0000)

### Project Flags
- **High Outlier**: Red background - Budget per beneficiary significantly above median
- **Low Outlier**: Yellow background - Budget per beneficiary significantly below median

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- 2D map overlays (severity/coverage) are placeholders - full Deck.gl/Mapbox integration pending
- Globe texture loads from external URL (may need local fallback)
- No authentication (MVP requirement)
- All data is synthetic (as per requirements)

### Potential Enhancements
- Full 2D map overlay integration with Deck.gl or Mapbox GL JS
- More sophisticated simulation models
- Historical comparison views
- Export functionality for reports
- Real-time data updates
- Multi-hurricane comparison mode

## License

This project is created for the Geo-Insight Challenge demonstration purposes.

## Notes

- All data is synthetic but based on realistic patterns from historical humanitarian responses
- Hurricane tracks are approximate representations of actual storm paths
- Budget and beneficiary numbers are simulated for demonstration
- The application prioritizes clarity, interpretability, and reproducibility over complexity
